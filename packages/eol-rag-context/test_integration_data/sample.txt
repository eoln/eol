This is a sample text file for testing the indexing system.

The file contains multiple paragraphs to test the document processing and chunking capabilities of the RAG system.

This paragraph discusses the importance of semantic search and how vector embeddings can be used to find relevant content based on meaning rather than just keyword matching.

Another paragraph covers the benefits of hierarchical indexing, where documents are broken down into concepts, sections, and chunks for more granular retrieval.

Finally, this paragraph explains how non-blocking indexing allows the system to process documents without blocking other operations, improving overall system responsiveness.
