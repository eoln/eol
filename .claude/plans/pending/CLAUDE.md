# Pending State Rules

- Create dedicated git branch before starting execution
- Branch naming: feat/[plan-name] or fix/[plan-name]
- Update progress in real-time
- Mark tasks complete immediately
- Track blockers actively
- Commit changes incrementally with clear messages

## Execution Requirements

1. Create feature branch first
2. Update task checkboxes as you work
3. Commit after each major milestone
4. Document any deviations from plan
5. Note lessons learned as you go

## Progress Tracking

- Use [~] for in-progress tasks
- Update immediately when status changes
- Add notes for blocked items
- Keep plan file current
