# Performance Optimizations

## Ultra-Fast Dependency Caching

The project now includes an ultra-fast dependency caching system that significantly reduces CI/CD build times.

### Performance Metrics

| Setup Method | First Run | Cached Run | Improvement |
|--------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Traditional PyPI | 30-60s | 10-20s | - |
| Ultra-Fast Wheels | 5-10s | 5-10s | 3-6x faster |

### How It Works

1. **Weekly Optimization**: Pre-built wheel caches created every Sunday
2. **Artifact Distribution**: Wheels distributed via GitHub artifacts
3. **Graceful Fallback**: Automatic fallback to PyPI caching if wheels unavailable
4. **Lock File Precision**: Uses `uv.lock` for deterministic dependency resolution

### Status Reporting

The system provides detailed status reporting:
- ‚ö° **Ultra-Fast**: Using pre-built wheel cache
- üì¶ **PyPI Cached**: Using PyPI with aggressive caching
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Fallback**: Wheel cache corrupted, using PyPI fallback

### Robustness Features

- Comprehensive validation of wheel cache integrity
- Graceful handling of missing or corrupted artifacts
- Detailed performance metrics and optimization tips
- Automatic retry logic for transient failures
- Cross-workflow artifact access using GitHub CLI
