# Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) Commands

## Overview
PRP commands implement a systematic planning methodology for creating, executing, and maintaining comprehensive implementation blueprints for feature development.

## PRP Planning Workflow
1. **Analyze** - Extract patterns and context from existing codebase
2. **Create** - Generate comprehensive implementation blueprint
3. **Review** - Review and refine the plan for accuracy
4. **Execute** - Execute plan with systematic task tracking
5. **Validate** - Validate plan completeness and results

## Command Structure
- **analyze.md**: Extract patterns from codebase for planning context
- **create.md**: Generate detailed implementation blueprints
- **review.md**: Review and update existing PRPs
- **execute.md**: Execute plans with task tracking
- **validate.md**: Validate plan feasibility and completeness

## PRP Methodology

### Blueprint Generation
PRP commands generate comprehensive implementation plans that include:
- Architecture design
- Implementation tasks
- Testing strategy
- Performance targets
- Success metrics

### Systematic Execution
- Phase-based implementation
- Real-time task tracking
- Quality gates at each phase
- Performance validation

## Best Practices
1. Always analyze before creating PRPs
2. Use systematic task tracking
3. Validate at each phase
4. Document lessons learned
5. Update context with discoveries
