# PRP Commands - Product Requirements Prompt System for EOL RAG Framework

Comprehensive Python-focused command suite for context engineering and systematic RAG feature development in the EOL monorepo with Redis vector database infrastructure.

## Overview

Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) commands enable high-quality, one-pass Python/RAG feature development by providing comprehensive implementation context derived from existing codebase patterns.

## Command Suite

### Core Commands

| Command | Purpose | Usage |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `analyze` | Extract RAG patterns and Redis context | `/prp:analyze "domain" "technology"` |
| `create` | Generate comprehensive RAG implementation blueprints | `/prp:create "feature description"` |
| `execute` | Execute PRPs with task tracking and validation | `/prp:execute .claude/plans/prp-file.md` |
| `validate` | Validate implementation quality and completeness | `/prp:validate .claude/plans/prp-file.md` |
| `check-quality` | Run comprehensive quality gates | `/prp:check-quality [package] [--full|--quick]` |

### Quick Start Workflow

```bash
# 1. Analyze existing RAG patterns
/prp:analyze "document-processing" "vector-search"

# 2. Create implementation blueprint
/prp:create "enhanced semantic caching with TTL management"

# 3. Execute with systematic tracking
/prp:execute .claude/plans/prp-semantic-caching.md

# 4. Validate quality and completeness
/prp:validate .claude/plans/prp-semantic-caching.md --full
```

## Key Features

### Python-First Development
- Strong type hints throughout implementation
- Async/await patterns for I/O operations
- Dataclasses and protocols for structures
- Pytest testing with comprehensive fixtures

### RAG Context Engineering
- Document processing patterns (chunking, embeddings)
- Vector search optimization strategies
- Semantic caching implementations
- Redis vector database patterns

### Quality Assurance
- Black formatting compliance
- isort import ordering
- Flake8 and mypy validation
- 80%+ test coverage requirement
- Performance benchmarking

### Task Management Integration
- TodoWrite integration for progress tracking
- State-based plan management (draft → ready → pending → completed)
- Git branch strategy for plan execution
- Quality gate checkpoints

## Integration with EOL Framework

### Leverages Existing Systems
- `.claude/context/` files for domain patterns
- RAG-specific context (document processing, vector search, caching)
- Redis patterns and best practices
- Python async patterns and type hints

### Supports Development Workflow
- Feature planning with checkbox format
- Code review and quality assurance
- Virtual environment management
- Documentation and knowledge sharing

## Command Documentation

Each command includes comprehensive help documentation:

- **analyze.md** - Codebase analysis and RAG pattern extraction
- **create.md** - PRP generation with Python/RAG focus
- **execute.md** - Systematic implementation with validation
- **validate.md** - Quality assurance and compliance checking
- **check-quality.md** - Comprehensive quality gate execution

## Python/RAG Specific Adaptations

### From TypeScript to Python
- Type hints instead of TypeScript interfaces
- Pytest instead of Jest
- Black/isort instead of ESLint
- uv instead of npm/nx

### RAG-Specific Patterns
- Document chunking strategies (semantic, AST, fixed)
- Embedding generation and management
- Vector search optimization
- Semantic caching with Redis
- Hierarchical indexing patterns

### Redis Integration
- Connection pooling patterns
- Vector index design
- Performance tuning strategies
- Pipeline operations for batch processing

## Benefits

### Development Efficiency
- **Reduced Implementation Time**: Context-rich PRPs enable faster development
- **Higher Success Rate**: Comprehensive blueprints reduce iteration cycles
- **Consistent Quality**: Leveraging proven RAG patterns ensures maintainability

### Code Quality

- **Redis Integration**: Proven vector database patterns

### Team Productivity
- **Knowledge Sharing**: PRPs capture and distribute RAG implementation wisdom
- **Onboarding**: New team members learn from comprehensive examples
- **Consistency**: Standardized patterns across all RAG development
