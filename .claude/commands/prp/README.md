# PRP Commands - Product Requirements Prompt Planning Methodology

Systematic planning methodology for creating comprehensive implementation blueprints for RAG feature development in the EOL framework.

## Overview

Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) commands implement a structured planning methodology that transforms feature requirements into detailed, actionable implementation blueprints. These commands focus on the planning and design phase of development, ensuring thorough preparation before coding begins.

## Command Suite

### Core Planning Commands

| Command | Purpose | Usage |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `analyze` | Extract patterns from codebase for planning | `/prp:analyze "domain" "technology"` |
| `create` | Generate comprehensive implementation blueprint | `/prp:create "feature description"` |
| `execute` | Execute PRP plan with systematic tracking | `/prp:execute .claude/plans/prp-file.md` |
| `validate` | Validate PRP completeness and feasibility | `/prp:validate .claude/plans/prp-file.md` |
| `review` | Review and update existing PRPs | `/prp:review .claude/plans/prp-file.md` |

### Quick Start Workflow

```bash
# 1. Analyze existing RAG patterns
/prp:analyze "document-processing" "vector-search"

# 2. Create implementation blueprint
/prp:create "enhanced semantic caching with TTL management"

# 3. Execute with systematic tracking
/prp:execute .claude/plans/prp-semantic-caching.md

# 4. Validate quality and completeness
/prp:validate .claude/plans/prp-semantic-caching.md --full
```

## PRP Methodology Focus

### Planning Philosophy
PRP commands implement the structured planning methodology detailed in [`.claude/context/planning-methodology.md`](../../context/planning-methodology.md).

PRP commands are specifically designed for the **planning and design phase** of development:
- **Not** for executing code quality checks (use `/quality:*` commands)
- **Not** for PR preparation (use `/project:prepare-pr`)
- **Not** for documentation updates (use `/project:update-docs`)
- **Focused** on creating, reviewing, and executing implementation blueprints

### What PRPs Do
1. **Analyze** existing codebase patterns for context
2. **Create** detailed implementation blueprints
3. **Execute** plans with systematic task tracking
4. **Validate** plan completeness and feasibility
5. **Review** and update plans to maintain accuracy

### Blueprint Components
- Architecture design and component structure
- Implementation tasks with phases
- Testing strategy and coverage approach
- Performance targets and benchmarks
- Success metrics and validation criteria

### Planning Integration
- TodoWrite integration for task tracking
- State-based plan lifecycle (draft → ready → pending → completed)
- Git branch strategy for plan execution
- Systematic phase-based implementation

## Integration with EOL Framework

### Leverages Existing Systems
- `.claude/context/` files for domain patterns
- RAG-specific context (document processing, vector search, caching)
- Redis patterns and best practices
- Python async patterns and type hints

### Supports Development Workflow
- Feature planning with checkbox format
- Code review and quality assurance
- Virtual environment management
- Documentation and knowledge sharing

## Command Documentation

Each command includes comprehensive help documentation:

- **analyze.md** - Codebase analysis and RAG pattern extraction
- **create.md** - PRP generation with Python/RAG focus
- **execute.md** - Systematic implementation with validation
- **validate.md** - Quality assurance and compliance checking
- **review.md** - Review and update existing PRPs

## Python/RAG Specific Adaptations

### From TypeScript to Python
- Type hints instead of TypeScript interfaces
- Pytest instead of Jest
- Black/isort instead of ESLint
- uv instead of npm/nx

### RAG-Specific Patterns
- Document chunking strategies (semantic, AST, fixed)
- Embedding generation and management
- Vector search optimization
- Semantic caching with Redis
- Hierarchical indexing patterns

### Redis Integration
- Connection pooling patterns
- Vector index design
- Performance tuning strategies
- Pipeline operations for batch processing

## Benefits

### Development Efficiency
- **Reduced Implementation Time**: Context-rich PRPs enable faster development
- **Higher Success Rate**: Comprehensive blueprints reduce iteration cycles
- **Consistent Quality**: Leveraging proven RAG patterns ensures maintainability

### Code Quality
- **Python Best Practices**: Type hints and async patterns
- **Testing Excellence**: Pytest patterns with high coverage
- **Redis Integration**: Proven vector database patterns

### Team Productivity
- **Knowledge Sharing**: PRPs capture and distribute RAG implementation wisdom
- **Onboarding**: New team members learn from comprehensive examples
- **Consistency**: Standardized patterns across all RAG development
