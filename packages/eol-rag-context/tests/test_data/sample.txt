This is a plain text file for testing document processing.

It contains multiple paragraphs with various content that should be
properly chunked and indexed by the RAG system.

The system should handle:
- Text extraction
- Proper chunking
- Metadata extraction
- Hierarchical organization

Each paragraph should be processed according to the configured
chunking strategy, preserving semantic meaning while optimizing
for the LLM context window.
