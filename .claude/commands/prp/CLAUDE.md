# Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) Commands

## Overview
PRP commands provide systematic implementation blueprints for feature development with comprehensive context engineering.

## Workflow
1. Analyze existing patterns and context
2. Create comprehensive implementation blueprint
3. Execute with systematic tracking
4. Validate quality and completeness

## Command Structure
- **analyze.md**: Extract patterns from codebase
- **create.md**: Generate implementation blueprints
- **execute.md**: Execute with task tracking
- **validate.md**: Validate implementation quality
- **check-quality.md**: Run quality checks

## PRP Methodology

### Blueprint Generation
PRP commands generate comprehensive implementation plans that include:
- Architecture design
- Implementation tasks
- Testing strategy
- Performance targets
- Success metrics

### Systematic Execution
- Phase-based implementation
- Real-time task tracking
- Quality gates at each phase
- Performance validation

## Best Practices
1. Always analyze before creating PRPs
2. Use systematic task tracking
3. Validate at each phase
4. Document lessons learned
5. Update context with discoveries
