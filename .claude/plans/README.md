# Plans Directory Guide

## State Definitions
- **draft/**: Initial ideas, exploration, incomplete
- **ready/**: Validated, approved, ready to execute
- **pending/**: Currently being executed
- **completed/**: Finished, archived for reference

## Workflow
draft → ready → pending → completed

## File Naming
Use descriptive kebab-case: feature-name-plan.md

## Task Management
Within each plan, use checkboxes to track progress:
- `[ ]` - Task not started
- `[~]` - Task in progress
- `[x]` - Task completed
- `[!]` - Task blocked

## Best Practices
1. One plan per feature or major change
2. Include success metrics in plans
3. Document dependencies clearly
4. Extract lessons learned upon completion
5. Update relevant context/ files with discoveries
